# Code Description

This game presents a way to show your learning in compound if statements and conditional loops.

Computer randomly chooses rock-paper-scissors, and waits for the player to respond.
Player is asked if they are choosing rock, paper or scissors. They play against the computer, which chooses randomly.

Here are the ways this is judged:
Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)
Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)
Rock beats scissors (rock smashes scissors)
If both choose the same, it is a tie.
The idea is that there is no true fallback position that “always wins”.
When a game is over, the user is asked if they want to play again. If no, the program exits giving the number of user wins out of the total games played..

Write a program where the computer is both the opponent and referee; and there is one human player.
The program must consist of multiple IF and/or switch/case statements, making use of boolean operators such as AND (&&) and OR (||). The player will also be told at the end the number of wins during the current session.
