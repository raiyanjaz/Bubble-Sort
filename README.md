# Code Description

You need an array of 20 ages of adult college students (ages all > 18), to the nearest tenth of a year. Using a bubble sort algorithm, write a Java program to sort these data from youngest to oldest.
-- Sort the array from youngest to oldest

Return data: 
    1. The sorted list of students, 10 students per row for 2 rows
    2. Select the Youngest student: (should be the first datum in the list after sorting)
    3. Select the Oldest student: (should be the last datum in the list after sorting)
    
No functions are required for this program (unless you want to).
Remember to give meaningful names to your array and variables, and format your code so that it is easily read. Also, give descriptive comments.
