# Rock-Paper-Scissor Game

Computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and waits for the player to respond. The player is asked if they are choosing rock, paper or scissors and competes with the computer.

Here are the ways this is judged:
Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)
Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)
Rock beats scissors (rock smashes scissors)
If both choose the same, it is a tie.
The idea is that there is no true fallback position that “always wins”.
When a game is over, the user is asked if they want to play again. If no, the program exits giving the number of user wins out of the total games played.
